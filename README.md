## Hi there üëã
## Roman is in touch!
I'm a Python developer üêç and a journalist ‚úíÔ∏è. Since you're here to learn more about the former, let me tell you about my recent coding endeavors. Here's a list of my most recent projects:

- üçÑ Developed an [application][cooking_service] for publishing recipes (Django Rest Framework, React). Users can follow authors, create a list of favorites, and generate shopping lists. The project is containerized in Docker, and the web server runs on Nginx.

- üìù Launched a [To Do][To Do] application (Django Rest Framework, React). It enables users to create tasks, track their completion, mark them as completed, and add comments. The web server is also powered by Nginx, and the deployment is managed via Git Workflow.

- üìñ Created a social network using Django. Users can publish diaries and notes, subscribe to other users, and comment on their articles. There are two versions of the project: one based on [Django templates][YaMDB templates] and the other an [API version][YaMDB API] using Django Rest Framework.

- üêô Developed a [platform][Kittygram] for sharing pet photos (Django Rest Framework, React). Users can create accounts, upload pictures of animals with descriptions, and view posts by other authors. Similar to my other projects, this one runs in Docker containers, with the web server being served by Nginx. Deployment is handled via Git Workflow.

- üî± I've also written a [Telegram bot][Homework-bot] that, based on requests to the API of a third-party resource, monitors the status of user accounts.

- üö¥ Designed a [fitness tracker][Fitnes-tracker] module. Depending on the type of workout and other data, the module calculates the number of calories burned and the distance traveled.
