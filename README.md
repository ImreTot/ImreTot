## Hi there üëã
## Roman is in touch!
I'm a Python developer üêç and journalist ‚úíÔ∏è. You're here to know more about the first one, so let's tell you more about the code. Here is a list of my recent projects:

- üçÑ Developed an [application][cooking_service] for publishing recipes (Django Rest Framework, Node JS). Users can follow authors, create a list of favorites and create a shopping list. The project runs in Docker containers. Web server - Nginx.

- üìù Launched the [To Do][To Do] application (Django Rest Framework, Node JS). It allows you to create tasks, track their completion, mark them as completed, and leave comments. Web server - Nginx. Deploy via Git Workflow.

- üìñ Created a social network using Django. Users can publish their diaries and notes, subscribe to other users, and comment on their articles. There are two versions of the project - based on [Django templates][YaMDB templates] and an [API version][YaMDB API] (Django Rest Framework).

- üêô Developed a [platform][Kittygram] for publishing photos of pets (Django Rest Framework, Node JS). Users can create accounts, leave pictures of animals with descriptions, and view posts by other authors. The project runs in Docker containers. Web server - Nginx. Deploy via Git Workflow.

- üî± I wrote a [Telegram bot][Homework-bot] that, based on requests to the API of a third-party resource, monitors the status of the user‚Äôs account.

- üö¥ Designed a [fitness tracker][Fitnes-tracker] module. Depending on the type of workout and other data, the module calculates the number of calories burned and the distance traveled.

### About me
A technician who was captured by humanitarians. I have always been interested in technology and science. I love to read and enthusiastically retell books to friends. I can explain any topic in simple language. 
I can‚Äôt imagine my life without extreme sports and travel - this is what gives me strength, teaches me to cope with the impossible and energizes me.
